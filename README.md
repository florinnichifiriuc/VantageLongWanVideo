# Vantage Long Wan Video 

**VantageLongWanVideo** is a lightweight project management system for **ComfyUI**, designed for long-running, prompt-driven video generation. It simplifies workflow management by saving prompts to disk, handling continuity across runs, and allowing resuming or regenerating from any point.

	 - **Vantage Project Loader** ‚Üí Project manager node (saves/loads scripts, computes start points)
	 - **Vantage I2V Single Model Looper** ‚Üí For **Wan 2.1 / Wan 2.2 AIO** workflows
	 - **Vantage I2V Dual Model Looper** ‚Üí For **Wan 2.2 High/Low noise** workflows

## ‚ú® Features

-   Save and load prompt scripts as JSON files
-   Automatic `start_prompt` calculation based on existing output folders    
-   Resume generation from any prompt index    
-   Extend projects with new prompts without re-rendering previous clips    
-   Regenerate selected segments by specifying a positive `start_prompt`    
-   Organized output structure for easy project management    
-   Works with both **single-model** and **dual-model** workflows
